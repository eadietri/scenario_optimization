# Scenario Optimization for Data-Driven Reachability Analysis

Ellipsoids folder contains all code relevant for reachable sets with ellipsoids as a volume proxy. 
ellipsoids.py contains the scenario optimization code for calculating reachable sets.
lorenz_example.py provides a "dummy" example for ellipsoidal reachable sets.
vessel_example.py provides a vessel example, run using the Gunnerus vessel model (which can be found in mclsimpy).

Run "vessel_example.py" to see an example of the ellipsods at work!
